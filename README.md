# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Import math
### Step 2: 
And get a two values from the user as input
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.jpg)
### Step 4: 
print the statement with .format 
### Step 5: 
End the program
### PROGRAM:

import math 
l1 = [4,2]
l2 = [10,6]
d = math.sqrt((l2[0]-l1[0])**2+(l2[1]-l1[1])**2)
print("{:.2f}".format(d))

```
